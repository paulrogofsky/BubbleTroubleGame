This was my CIS120 final project. The goal of this project was to get us acquainted with Object Oriented Programming in Java and the 
Graphics libraries supported by Java. I created a game called bubble trouble, which can be found on Miniclip, and which I enjoy very much.
Game.java is the file to be executed.
